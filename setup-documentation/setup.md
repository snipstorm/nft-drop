# setup

Here's where I'll be taking y'all through the process
we'll be learning typescript super easily apparently.

Maybe I can collaborate with Wacks to make this an actual drop LMFAO

I fucking ran into this moronic problem again where there's multiple ways to do this.

```npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss nft-drop-app```
nvm it's all g

`https://docs.thirdweb.com/react`
SDK that we're using to connect to third-web
metamask login feature allow us to implement this small bit of code, for login/logout functionality.

we're gonna use `yarn` today.
```yarn run dev```

we're gonna barebones it

Sorting TailwindCSS class Auto with Prettier

```npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss```

`yarn` list all dependencies
```yarn list --depth 0```

`ncu` works with yarn, that's a relief
but we also get to keep the `package.json` file around.
just we have a `yarn.lock`
